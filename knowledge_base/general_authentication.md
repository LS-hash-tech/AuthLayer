General authentication knowledge:

All items start from 100% as authentication percentage, they drop percentage based on the following conditions:



1) Title and description wording:

 if it any of the following is found in the title or description:

  "fake", "not real", "replica", "Dupe", "Dup", "Copycat", "Not authentic", "Non-authentic", "Counterfeit", "Imitation", "rep", "Knockoff". "Not auth"

 Then the chances of being authentic drop from 100% to 0-5%.

  ***(for "replica" we needs to be cautious, margiela use it often as part of their "reproduction of older garments in a modern era", which means that users that liste this brand should be allowed to use replica in the description and percentage should not drop.)***





2) Seller items and number of reviews across account:

 If the seller has 0 reviews 
 
 And sells multiple similar / same designer items, with the same condition across them.
 
 Then drop % significantly, this could be up to 40% drop from initial percentage.

 
 


3) Reviews wording: 

 If 1 or more seller reviews mention anything of the below: 

   "fake", "not real", "replica", "Dupe", "Dup", "Copycat", "Not authentic", "Non-authentic", "Counterfeit", "Imitation", "rep", "Knockoff". "Not auth"
   
 Then chances of being auth drop significantly, like 50%
 
 And an extra 25% drop for anything above 1 review that includes any of those keywords.

 Also take into consideration the amount of reviews that the seller has - Example: 
 
 If they have 2000 reviews and one says fake then it should not drop that dramatically, possibly only 15%. 
 
 If someone has just created an account or has like 10 reviews and one includes any of those keywords, then in this case the percentage should drop significantly.

  ***(for "replica" we needs to be cautious: margiela use it often as part of their "reproduction of older garments in a modern era", which means that users that liste this brand should be allowed to use replica in the description and percentage should not drop.)***
