Margiela authentication knowledge:

1) Footwear:

 ***Margiela GATs / replica*** 
 are some of the pair that gets most fakes produced, due to them being more mainstream.

 Signs to spot the difference, authentic vs fake:
 

 On an Authentic pair: 
 
 On authentic Margiela GATs, the heel tab is thin, flat, and sits flush against the back of the shoe with minimal padding. The ankle collar has a slim, structured profile. 


 On a fake pair:
 
 The heel tab is overstuffed and puffy, protruding outward from the shoe. The ankle collar appears bloated and rounded, giving the back of the shoe a bulky, unrefined shape. This is the single most reliable visual indicator for spotting fake GATs without handling the shoe.


2) Supreme x margiela collections:

 ***Supreme x MM6 Zip up Hoodie:***
 

  Label Attachment Method

  the authentic: The label is sewn directly into the seam where the hood lining meets the body. It's integrated into the garment construction — flush and clean, not sitting on top.

  the fake: The MM6 x Supreme number label is sewn onto a separate dark brown/black fabric backing, then mounted on top of the garment like a patch on a patch. Looks layered and raised from the surface.

  The fake: stitching on the brand label "supreme" inside the hooide has stitching going over the "P" letter, this is not consistent with the authentic one.


  Stitching at Hood-Body Junction
  
  The authentic: The stitching is tight, clean, and precise. The skull print lining and teal fleece body are joined seamlessly with no fraying or bunching.
  
  The fake: The stitching where the skull print hood lining meets the teal fleece body is loose, uneven, and slightly frayed. The two materials don't sit flush together.


  Label Fabric & Print Quality

  The authentic: Clean bright white label fabric. Numbers are crisp with even, consistent spacing. The circled "6" and "Supreme" text are sharp and proportionally correct.

  The fake: The white label fabric appears slightly off-white or yellowish. The numbers and "Supreme" text have slightly bolder weight and less consistent spacing between characters.



 ***Supreme x MM6 Maison Margiela Receipt Wallet:***

  The authentic: The embossed numbers, circled 6, and "Supreme" box logo are pressed deep and clean into the leather with sharp, defined edges. Each number is evenly spaced and clearly legible. The leather itself has a smooth, matte finish with fine grain. The stitching along the top edge is tight and uniform. The card slot cuts are clean and precise.

  The fake: The embossing is shallower and less defined — the numbers and "Supreme" box look slightly mushy, like they didn't press hard enough into the leather. The circled 6 is less crisp, with the circle appearing thicker and less proportional. The leather has a shinier, almost plastic-like sheen compared to the authentic's matte texture. The overall impression is that the stamping lacks depth and precision.





4) ***Margiela Tabi***:

The fake: has no logos and no classic numbered engravings under the sole.






5) ***margiela sweaters and knit*** 

The fake: often has "DWMZ" right above the size tag omn the neck, which has been a consistent sign across all faked of this sweater model + knit model. 

The fake: On top of this the stitching is often not exaclty at each corner of the brand label. fakes also are missing the size tag.
